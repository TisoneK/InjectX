# Inefficiency Log (append-only, mandatory)

Every session appends one block — honestly. Friction you absorb silently
is friction the next agent hits blind. "None this session" is valid only
if literally nothing slowed you down.

- **Problem 1:** Env vars set via `export GIT_TOKEN=...` in one Bash tool call do NOT persist to subsequent Bash calls in the Z.ai sandbox. Each call starts a fresh shell. The Bash tool description says "persistent shell session" but that's misleading.
- **Cost:** ~5 minutes wasted before discovering the cause; then re-pasting the PAT inline on every push command for the rest of the session (8 pushes = 8 redundant `GIT_TOKEN='...'` lines).
- **Cause:** The sandbox's Bash tool wraps each command in a fresh non-interactive shell — env vars don't survive.
- **Workaround / fix:** Two options: (a) re-export the env var inline at the start of every Bash command that uses it (`GIT_TOKEN='github_pat_...' && git ...`); (b) store the PAT at `.context/secrets/github-pat` (gitignored, 0600 perms) once, then read it back inline: `GIT_TOKEN=$(head -1 .context/secrets/github-pat) && git ...`. This session used (b) — stored the PAT once and read it back on each push.
- **Prevent next time:** Documented in `system/environments.md` "Quirks" section — future Z.ai sandbox agents on this project will see the warning and skip the discovery phase.

- **Problem 2:** The architecture doc (`docs/InjectX-Architecture.md`) is significantly stale vs the v0.4 implementation — describes HAT/DARK/TLS as having "no public decryptor" but the code has working decryptors for HAT (E1) and TLS (F1); says EHI uses "base64 unlock" but code uses 2-stage AES (B1); lists `python-magic` in requirements but it's neither in `requirements.txt` nor imported.
- **Cost:** ~10 minutes reconciling doc-vs-code claims during the discovery phase; would have been worse if I had trusted the doc and skipped reading the actual decrypt files.
- **Cause:** The doc was written for a proposed v1.0 redesign and never updated as the v0.4 implementation surpassed it.
- **Workaround / fix:** Read the actual code (`backend/decrypt/*.py`) and ignored the doc's claims for any factual question. Flagged the doc rewrite as backlog item N1.
- **Prevent next time:** Backlog N1 — rewrite the architecture doc to match v0.4 (or mark it explicitly as "historical proposal — see code").

- **Problem 3:** No test infrastructure exists — no `tests/`, no `pytest` config, no sample config files to verify decryption against. Each fix had to be verified by ad-hoc `curl` calls against a freshly-started backend.
- **Cost:** ~15 minutes total spent starting/stopping the backend and crafting test inputs for each fix verification.
- **Cause:** Project never had test infrastructure; the team relied on manual testing through the Electron UI.
- **Workaround / fix:** Used `python main.py &` + `sleep 2` + `curl` + `kill` for each verification. Created a small `/tmp/test.ehi` ZIP file as a known-good sample.
- **Prevent next time:** Backlog N3 — add `pytest` + sample config files + happy-path tests per format. Highest-leverage next session.

- **Problem 4:** The `npm install` postinstall script for `electron` was skipped by `npm`'s conservative `allow-scripts` default, but the electron binary was still installed in `node_modules/electron/`. There was no warning that the postinstall was skipped until I looked at the install output carefully.
- **Cost:** ~3 minutes verifying electron was actually installed.
- **Cause:** npm 11's `allow-scripts` feature defaults to skipping postinstall scripts unless explicitly approved.
- **Workaround / fix:** Verified electron was in `node_modules/electron/` and that `npx electron --version` would work locally (it would NOT work in this sandbox due to no display server, but the binary is present for desktop machines).
- **Prevent next time:** Document in `system/environments.md` that `npm install --no-audit --no-fund` works but electron postinstall is skipped — note this is fine because the binary still installs, and the postinstall script only handles native module rebuilds which aren't needed for this project.

## 2026-07-15 — Claude Code / claude-fable-5 (Session 2)

- **Problem:** After editing `main.py`, I restarted the backgrounded backend with `pkill -f "python main.py"` + relaunch, but the OLD process survived the pkill and kept holding port 8799. The new process failed to bind (`Errno 48 address already in use`, visible only in its log) and I unknowingly kept cur/testing the STALE, unpatched backend — so my symlink fix appeared to "not work" (attack still returned 200).
- **Cost:** ~1 full test cycle + a few minutes of confusion diagnosing why a correct fix seemed ineffective, before checking `lsof` and finding the stale PID.
- **Cause:** `pkill -f` on a backgrounded process launched from a prior Bash tool call is unreliable in this harness (fresh shell per call; the background job isn't necessarily in pkill's match set or dies too slowly). uvicorn logs the bind failure but keeps the process alive serving nothing useful, and there's no foreground error.
- **Workaround / fix:** Always verify the port is actually free before restarting: `lsof -iTCP:<port> -sTCP:LISTEN -n -P`, then `kill -9 <specific-pid>`. Don't trust `pkill` alone. Recorded in `system/environments.md` quirks for this machine.
- **Prevent next time:** For iterative backend testing, either (a) kill by explicit PID captured from `$!` at launch and confirm with `lsof`, or (b) use a fresh port per restart. A stale-server check (health endpoint returning old behavior after a code change) should trigger an immediate `lsof` before further debugging.
